# PureScript Resources

This is a repository for a docs site on how to figure things out in PureScript.

This is a collection of notes and links to resources to learn and use PureScript as generally recommended by me. This is all biased information. Think of it as "awesome-how-to-purescript" that isn't just a link farm.
