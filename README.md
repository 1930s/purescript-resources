# PureScript Resources

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/purescript-resources/badge/?version=latest)](https://purescript-resources.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This is a repository for a docs site on how to figure things out in PureScript.

See the site at <https://purescript-resources.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

This is a collection of notes and links to resources to learn and use PureScript as generally recommended by me. This is all biased information. Think of it as "awesome-how-to-purescript" that isn't just a link farm.
