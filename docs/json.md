# JSON

Currently, I only use my own library Simple-JSON.

## Simple-JSON

Everything you've dreamed of when defining transport types or wanting to work with inferred serialization types for JSON. See its documentation at <http://purescript-simple-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

## Foreign

If you work with JS values, you will want to use the Foreign library. <https://github.com/purescript/purescript-foreign>

## Argonaut-Core

A library for working with Json values but in a different way. If you want automatic decoding of JSON, this is not the set of libraries you want to use. Otherwise, welcome.
