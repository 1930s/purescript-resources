# UI libraries

There are effectively two actively maintained and working solutions.

## Halogen

Pure PureScript. Fast if you don't write naive code with thousands of unkeyed children.

## React-Basic

Quite transparent React interop. Start by looking here: <https://github.com/f-f/purescript-react-basic-todomvc>

## No library

It might be worthwhile to not actually try to write your entire view in PureScript first, and rather interface in your existing application. You should read through the [FFI](./ffi.html) links.
