PureScript Resources
============================

This is a collection of notes and links to resources to learn and use PureScript as generally recommended by me. This is all biased information. Think of it as "awesome-how-to-purescript" that isn't just a link farm.

.. note:: If there is a topic you would like more help with that is not in this guide, open a issue in the Github repo for it to request it.
