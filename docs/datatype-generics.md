# Datatype Generics via Generics-Rep

If you've ever wanted to work with information about your data types in terms of generic types and representations that can be converted to and from, this is exactly what you've been looking for: <https://github.com/purescript/purescript-generics-rep>

Here is a tutorial on Generics-Rep in the Simple-JSON docs: <https://purescript-simple-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generics-rep.html>

For much more detailed information, refer to the GHC User guide <https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#generic-programming> and the Haskell generic-deriving library docs <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-deriving-1.12.1/docs/Generics-Deriving-Base.html>
